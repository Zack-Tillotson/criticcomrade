            <h2>Movie Suggestion</h2>
            <p>
                Here is the most popular movie in theaters this week, <em><?php print $title; ?></em>. There are 2 main
                pieces of information to look at, the average critic score and the CCCP suggestion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The average critic score is just the percentage of critics who liked the movie. Other sites, like Rotten
                Tomatoes and Metacritic simply give you this number. Critic Comrade goes a step beyond that by giving you
                the CCCP suggestion (<b>C</b>ritic<b>C</b>omrade.<b>C</b>om <b>P</b>ersonalized Suggestion). This is the personal suggestion our site has calculated for you based on what you
                have told us about what movies you like and the reviews of all the critics.
            </p>
            <p class="bold bottom-spacer">
                The CCCP suggestion is a quick, easy, and accurate way of deciding if a movie is worth watching!
