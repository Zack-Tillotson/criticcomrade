            <h2>Critics Suck</h2>
            <p>
                A critic is supposed to tell you what movies are good and which
                aren't, but everyone is different and everyone likes different
                movies. One person might hate a movie that someone else loves,
                how is a critic supposed to please them both? They can't, so
                they just tell people what movies they themselves liked and
                hope that you agree with them. Then the question is, how do you
                know which critics to listen to? Do you listen to them all?

            <h2>RottenTomatoes Is Dumb</h2>
            <p>

                is a great site. In this day in age I can't imagine trying to
                just use one newspaper or one critic to decide if I wanted to see
                a certain movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, RottenTomatoes is a very dumb site. All it does is get a
                bunch of <b>random critics</b> and throw them together in a bucket and
                say "65% of critics liked this movie". This doesn't work for you,
                though, because you don't care what Joe Movie-Snob-Critic has to
                say about a movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hasn't there ever been a movie that the critics loved and you
                hated? Wouldn't you rather have saved yourself $20? What if
                you could weed out all the snobs and morons and other people
                that don't like your kind of movies?
            </p>
            <h2>Critic Comrade knows who's opinion matters to you</h2>
            <p>
                Rather than telling you what the average review among all 
                critics is for a movie, you are given a score for a movie
                just based on the critics who agree with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>You review movies</b>, telling Critic Comrade what movies
                you liked and which you didn't. Critic Comrade then takes these
                reviews and matches them to critics. The ones who agree with
                you become your critic <b>Comrades</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are looking at a movie, trying to decide if you like
                it or not you can then consult with your Comrades and see what
                they have to say. Stop listening to the average masses and start
                listeing to the critics who matter to you.
