            <div class="faq-question"><a name="cc-what">What is Critic Comrade?</a></div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Critic Comrade is a movie review site that gives personalized suggestions on movies.</div>
            <div class="faq-question"><a name="cc-why">Why is Critic Comrade better?</a></div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Critic Comrade gives you personal suggestions on whether you will like a movie or not. Add to that the fact that Critic Comrade has the most reviews and is the most fun and it can't be beat :)</div>
            <h2>Movies</h2>
            <div class="faq-question"><a name="cccp-suggestion">What is a CCCP suggestion?</a></div>
            <div class="faq-answer">This is the personal suggestion Critic Comrade offers based on your taste in movies. (CCCP Suggestion stands for CriticComrade.Com Personalized Suggestion). </div>
            <div class="faq-question"><a name="rate-more">Why should I rate more movies?</a></div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Because Critic Comrade bases its suggestions on the movies you've rated previously, if you don't have enough reviews the suggestions won't be accurate. We've found that 15 reviews is a good minimum for accurate suggestions (but of course it's still useful with fewer than that).</div>
            <h2>Critics</h2>
            <div class="faq-question"><a name="best-critics">What are your best critics?</a></div>
            <div class="faq-answer">These are the critics you agree with the most.  They are also referred to on this site as your "Comrades", and they are the critics who have the most <a href="#agreeing-reviews">agreeing reviews</a> with you.</div>
            <div class="faq-question"><a name="agreeing-reviews">What is the "agreeing reviews" score for a critic?</a></div>
            <div class="faq-answer">This is the number of reviews that you and the critic agree on. So if you review 20 movies, and the critic reviews 100 movies, then you might have both reviewed 10 of the same movies. Of those 10 that you both reviewed, the more that you agree on the better.</div>
